    We needed to analyze fish population for a popular aquarium for a shop owner.
    We wanted both rainbowfish and gouramis, but gouramis eat rainbowfish so we
    beeded to build a mathematical modell to see if the populations would stabilize
    at an equilibrium or if they would die off in some way.

\end{flushleft}

\begin{flushleft}
    To modell this we made a system of differential equations that
    were then modelled on Python using eulers formula. We then showed
    that an equilibrium does infact exist.
\end{flushleft}

    Our conclusion was that this does infact work, and that the fishes
    form an equilibrium at roughly 31 rainbowfish and 12 gourami. This shows
    that having both fishes in the same aquarium is feasable. However the modell
    cannot controll for unexpected occurances.
