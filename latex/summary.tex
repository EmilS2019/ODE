    An analysis of a fish population at a popular aquarium for a shop owner was
    shown to be necessary. The shop owner wanted both rainbowfish and
    gouramis, despite gouramis appetite for rainbowfish so we
    needed to build a mathematical model to see if the populations
    would stabilize at an equilibrium or if they would die off over time.

\begin{flushleft}
    A system of differential equations were used to model the fish populations
    in Python using euler's formula. It was then shown
    that an equilibrium does in fact exist.

    The conclusion is that the aquarium owners original idea
    does in fact work, and that the fishes
    form a stable equilibrium at roughly 31 rainbowfish and 12 gourami. This shows
    that having both fishes in the same aquarium is feasible. However the modell
    cannot control for unexpected occurrences.
