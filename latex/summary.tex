    An analyzis of a fish population for a popular aquarium for a shop owner was
    shown to be neccecary.The shop owner wanted both rainbowfish and
    gouramis, but gouramis eat rainbowfish so we
    needed to build a mathematical modell to see if the populations
    would stabilize at an equilibrium or if they would die off in some way.

\end{flushleft}

\begin{flushleft}
    A system of differential equations were used to model the fish populations
    in Python using eulers formula. It then shows
    that an equilibrium does infact exist.
\end{flushleft}

\begin{flushleft}
    The conclusion is that this does infact work, and that the fishes
    form an equilibrium at roughly 31 rainbowfish and 12 gourami. This shows
    that having both fishes in the same aquarium is feasable. However the modell
    cannot controll for unexpected occurances.
