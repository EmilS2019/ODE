    The Melings Lake in Fagersta, VÃ¤stmanland, Sweden has been without
    fish for a hundred years. Today conservationists has asked us if
    an reintroduction of fish could boost the ecosystem. We decided on
    two types of fish and what the potential outcome would be. Would these
    two fishes go extingt and eat eachother up, or would they live in equelibrium?

    Since you can only buy so many fish we need to know how many is feasable
    and if the population will stabilize at a good point that doesn't
    lead to bad consequences.

    The purpose of this research is to find out how the fish will behave
    and if they will live in equilibrium with nature so that this effort
    is worth while.

    The limitations of this project is that it cannot simulate all of nature.
    It also doesn't take into account
