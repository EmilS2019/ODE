    The Aquarium we own needs more fish. We decided on
    two types of fish and what the potential outcome would be. Would these
    two fishes go extingt and eat eachother up, or would they live in equelibrium?

    Since you can only buy so many fish we need to know how many is feasable
    and if the population will stabilize at a good point that doesn't
    lead to bad consequences.

    The purpose of this research is to find out how the fish will behave
    and if they will live in equilibrium with nature so that this effort
    is worth while.

    The limitations of this project is that it cannot simulate all of nature
    and fish behaviour, just the population and how different populations
    interacts with eachother.

    In chapter 3 I discuss the early model for just rainbowfish. In
    chapter 4 I add a second fish, gourami fish that eats rainbowfish.
