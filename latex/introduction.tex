    An analysis of a fish population at a popular aquarium for a shop owner was
    shown to be necessary. The shop owner wanted both rainbowfish and
    gouramis, despite gouramis appetite for rainbowfish so we
    needed to build a mathematical model to see if the populations
    would stabilize at an equilibrium or if they would die off over time.

\end{flushleft}

\begin{flushleft}
    We have a budget constraint so we need to know how many fishes are feasible and if the population will stabilize at some point that doesn't
    lead to bad consequences such as all rainbowfish being eaten by the gouramis.

\end{flushleft}

\begin{flushleft}
    The purpose of this research is to find out how the fish population will adapt and evolve over time
    and if they can live in a stable equilibrium.

    The limitations of this project is that it cannot simulate all of nature and the fish-fish interaction. The model can only simulatie the population and how different populations
    interacts with each other.

    In chapter 3 I discuss the early model for just rainbowfish. In
    chapter 4 I add the gourami fish.
