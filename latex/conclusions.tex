    So in conclusion, could we keep 30 rainbowfish and 5 gourami's?
    Indeed this is the case. With our desired starting population of
    30 rainbowfish and 5 gouramis the fish population reaches a stable equilibrium.
    And this equilibrium is reached even with a large range of starting populations.
    This implies that we can buy fewer fishes to save money.

    However this model can only explain so much. Birth rates and death
    rates may be affected by unknown causes. And it cannot model the fact
    that fishes lay and hatch many eggs at once instead of continiously over time.
    But despite these drawbacks it's safe to say that the fishes will reach an
    equilibrium point.
